Hi, I am **Eduardo Bonet**, nice to meet you. I am a software developer, focusing mostly on Mobile (Android, Ionic) and Data Science (Python, R, ...), but I also do backend Go and Node.JS (a little of RoR maybe). I am fully realized when I can use my coding skills to tackle problems with a social impact, specially on education.

I majored in Control and Automation Engineering, but also took Computer Science at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology for a year. I am currently enrolled in a Master program. I am a coorganizer of the [Florianopolis Data Science Meetup][2c02a34a] and active member of [Code For Floripa][41d2cf28], a group of voluntary developers that work on tech solution to drive local social impact.

You can contact me at [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ef_bonet), [Github](http://github.com/ebonet), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardobonet).
