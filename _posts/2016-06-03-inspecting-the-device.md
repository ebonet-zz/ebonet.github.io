Ok, I don't know how I didn't discover this earlier. I've been using Ionic for 2 years now and never (I mean, NEVER) came across this amazing tool throughout this whole time:

##### The same way you can open a dev tool for the web browser, you can open a chrome dev tools window to the attached usb device

I used to run `ionic run android -l -c`, but it's waaaay to limited.

To open a Chrome Dev Tools window, attached to your device, open the browser on your computer and navigate to

```
chrome://inspect/‪#‎devices‬
```

Open your app, select your device and *BOOM*, everything you need is there:

You can even control, click, and navigate the app on your phone through your computer, and IT WAS ALWAYS THERE.

Mind Blown.
