Hi all! I am **Eduardo Bonet**, and I am a person. I a software developer, focusing mostly on Mobile (Android, Ionic, iOS) and Data Science (Python, R, ...), but I also do backend Go and Node.JS (a little of RoR maybe). I am fully realized when I can use my coding skills to tackle problems with a social impact, specially on education.


I majored in Control and Automation Engineering, but also took Computer Science at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology for a year. I am currently enrolled in a Master program.
